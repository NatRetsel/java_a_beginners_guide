# Chapter 1 Self Test

1. What is bytecode and why is it important to Java's use for Internet programming?
   - Bytecode is the compiled code of Java source code by the Java compiler. It contains instructions for the JVM on how to interpret instructions that are portable

   - Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism.
  
3. Where to Java programs begin execution?
   - `public static void main(String[] args) {//...}`
  
4. What is a variable?
   - A named memory region capable of storing values.
  
5. Which of the following variable names is invalid?
